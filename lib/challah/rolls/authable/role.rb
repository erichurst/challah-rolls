module Challah::Rolls
  # AuthableRole is used to extend functionality to a model in your app named Role. By default,
  # this model already exists within the challah engine.
  #
  # The Role model is used to group together sets of permissions that can be assigned
  # to users.
  #
  # Roles are not used to detect features or options for a user. Instead, you should
  # always use permissions as the most granular level of detail within your app.
  #
  # For example, to restrict a piece of your application to a certain user, you should create
  # a new permission level that restricts it. Then, you can assign that permission to roles
  # and users on an ad hoc basis.
  #
  # In most cases roles should not be accessed directly, and only be used as a means to
  # quickly assign a user to several permissions. In other words, checking to see what role
  # a user is assigned to in your app is probably not a great idea. Use permission checks instead.
  #
  # The administrator role, which is included in the seeds file by default, is automatically
  # able to access all permissions. All subsequently added permissions will also be added
  # to the administrator role.
  #
  # == Validations
  #
  # A role requires that a unique name be provided.
  #
  # == Associations
  #
  # The following associations are set on this model by default:
  #
  # * Has many *users* (connects to {AuthableUser User})
  # * Has many *permissions* (connects to {AuthablePermission Permission})
  #
  # The join table (permission_roles) is also included, but likely does not need to be
  # accessed directly.
  #
  # == Customizing the Role model
  #
  # By default, the Role model is included within the gem engine. However, if you wish to
  # include it within your app for any customizations, you can do so by creating a model
  # file named +role.rb+ and adding the +authable_role+ line near the top of the class.
  #
  # @example app/models/role.rb
  #   class Role < ActiveRecord::Base
  #     # Set up all role methods from challah gem
  #     authable_role
  #
  #     # Your customizations here..
  #   end
  module AuthableRole
    # This method sets up the +Role+ class with all baked in methods.
    #
    # A role requires the presence of the +name+ and +default_path+ attributes.
    #
    # Once this method has been called, the {InstanceMethods} and {ClassMethods} modules
    # will be accessibile within the Role model.
